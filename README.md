## Fork Updates
Moving to Python3, and PyQt5 (in progress)

## Todo
* Change to accept X-Plane datagrams (Specifically looking at X-Plane 10)
  * (Until X-Plane 11 goes on sale?)

## To Run:
*I haven't tried hooking up to a sim yet, and I think I've commented out the connects while moving to python3/pyqt5. But it'll be something along the lines of*
* `git clone https://github.com/dankolbrs/pyqt-flight-sim`
* `cd pyqt-flight-sim`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Enable datagrams in FlightGear
* `python3 qtpit.py`
